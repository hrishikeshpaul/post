Post is a web application to detect the part of speech of every word in a sentence. For the purpose of classification the parts of speech used here, in a global term have the following components : 'adj', 'adv', 'adp', 'conj', 'det', 'noun', 'num', 'pron', 'prt', 'verb'. This is the front-end application for the algorithm that can be found [here](https://github.com/hrishikeshpaul/pos-tagger.git).
